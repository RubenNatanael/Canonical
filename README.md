# Canonical

In the first exercise, I created the base Linux directory structure and installed BusyBox to provide the necessary commands inside the initramfs. After that, I generated the initramfs image and booted it with QEMU using the host’s kernel.

In the second exercise, I create a buffer and move through the file in chunks of the buffer size, replacing the content with random data.
Note: I wrote the code with some help because I’m not very familiar with the language.

In the code file, you will find information about possible test cases and when this program is useful.
